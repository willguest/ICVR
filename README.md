# Island Collective Virtual Reality 

Welcome to the ICVR repository, an Unity-based toolkit for designing cutting-edge immersive experiences on the Internet Computer.

## üì¶ Create a New Project

Make sure that [Unity 2020 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/programmer-features/2020-lts-tier2-features) is installed on your system.

Start a new URP project using [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).

Import the ICVR_Core and, if desired, the ICVR_DLC unity packages. \
*(Assets ‚Üí Import Package ‚Üí Custom Package)*

Open the ICVR Setup window. \
*(Windows ‚Üí WebXR ‚Üí ICVR Setup)*

Use the relevant buttons to complete the ICVR setup:

   - Switch build target to WebGL
   - Add dependencies: Newtonsoft Json and WebXR Export (as scoped UPM package)
   - Click on *Enable ICVR Settings* to add the `ICVR` Scripting Define Symbol.
   - Import relevant settings. Note that this will **override your current settings**.

Make sure that WebXR Export is enabled for the WebGL target.

*(Project Settings ‚Üí XR Plugin Management)*.

Open one of the scenes inside *Assets/ICVR/Scenes* to begin with an empty scene.

If also using the DLC (see [Releases](https://github.com/willguest/ICVR/releases)), open one of the scenes in *Assets/ICVR_Scenes* for some design examples.

### üëì Things to Remember When Building

In the *Build Settings* window, don't forget to add the current scene.

For compatibility with the [ICVR-React](https://github.com/willguest/icvr-react) template, place the build in a folder called `unity_build`.
